    from pyldfire import WildFire

    printer = PrettyPrinter(indent=2)

    wildfire = WildFire("api-key-goes-here")

    # Submit a local file
    with open("malware", "rb") as sample_file:
        results = wildfire.submit_file(sample_file)
    dumps(results)

    # File Hashes can be MD5,SHA1, or SHA256
    file_hash = "419251150a2f77422efa1e016d605d69"

    # Download a sample to a file
    with open("sample", "wb") as sample_file:
        sample_file.write(wildfire.get_sample(file_hash))

    # Or keep it as a file-like object in memory instead
    sample = BytesIO(wildfire.get_sample(file_hash))

    # Same for PCAPs and PDF reports

    # Get a verdict
    verdict = wildfire.get_verdicts([file_hash])
